# Explanation of XGBoost and Quantum Models

## What Is XGBoost?

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful machine learning method that creates many decision trees and combines them to improve prediction accuracy. It works by learning patterns in the data step-by-step, focusing on correcting errors of previous trees, thus better capturing complex relationships.

**Key Points:**
- Builds an ensemble of trees iteratively.
- Good for handling lots of features and complex data.
- Helps with imbalanced data and rare event prediction.

## What Is Quantum Machine Learning (Using PennyLane)?

Quantum machine learning uses quantum computing concepts to analyze data. Instead of bits (0 or 1), quantum bits (qubits) can represent multiple states at once (superposition), enabling unique ways to capture complex data patterns.

**PennyLane** is a Python library that helps create and train quantum circuits for machine learning, mixing classical and quantum computation.

Quantum models might offer advantages on hard problems by leveraging quantum phenomena like entanglement.

## Step-by-Step Explanation of Your Code

### 1. Importing Libraries

- Imports standard Python packages for data processing (`numpy`, `pandas`), machine learning (`scikit-learn`), and plotting (`matplotlib`).
- Imports XGBoost for gradient boosting.
- Imports PennyLane and its tools for quantum computing.
- Sets up a consistent environment by fixing a random seed and silencing warnings.

### 2. Loading and Preprocessing Data

- Reads dataset CSV, cleans data by stripping unwanted characters and converting to numbers.
- Identifies disease columns automatically.
- Fills missing data with forward and backward filling.
- Extracts time features like month and creates cyclic features (sine/cosine) for seasonal patterns.
- Creates rolling average features for weather and diseases.
- Creates interaction features like temp * humidity to capture combined effects.

### 3. Creating Targets for Prediction

- Defines outbreaks as whether disease cases exceed the 85th percentile.
- Shifts outbreak flags forward by one week to create a "next week outbreak" target for prediction.

### 4. Preparing Features and Split Data

- Collects all engineered features into a list.
- Splits data 80:20 into training and test sets, ensuring no data leakage across time.
- Removes diseases with insufficient variance in target.

### 5. Training or Loading XGBoost Model

- Loads pretrained model if available, else trains a new model using hyperparameter search (`RandomizedSearchCV`).
- Uses `MultiOutputClassifier` to train a single model that predicts outbreaks for all diseases simultaneously.
- Utilizes GPU acceleration for faster training and prediction.

### 6. Quantum Model Setup and Training

- Selects a target disease and four climate features.
- Scales features to [0, π] for quantum rotations.
- Creates a quantum device backend, preferring GPU simulation if available.
- Defines a quantum circuit where each input feature controls rotation of a qubit.
- Uses entanglement (CNOT gates) to allow qubit interactions.
- Trains the circuit parameters (weights) to minimize prediction error using an optimizer (Adam).
- Saves trained weights and scaler for reuse.

### 7. Quantum Model Evaluation

- Runs quantum circuit on test features.
- Converts quantum measurements into outbreak predictions (1 or 0).
- Calculates and prints accuracy and F1 score.

## Summary

- **XGBoost** learns many decision trees that work together to predict disease outbreaks using classical computing.
- **Quantum model** uses quantum circuits to encode data and find complex data patterns that might be inaccessible to classical models.
- Your code combines robust classical methods with promising quantum algorithms, showing how hybrid quantum-classical models can improve outbreak prediction.
